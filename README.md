## ✨ Overview

**AK** is an advanced AI assistant powered by the **SARTHI** engine.

Say "play the new Dune trailer" and the video appears **where the avatar was**, in the HUD itself, muted until you ask for sound. A YouTube link, a local file, a direct URL or just a description to search for: they all land in the same place, and SARTHI tells you it is coming *before* the picture arrives instead of going quiet for five seconds.

Underneath, every Gemini call in the app now goes through **one ladder of nine models**, ordered by measured response time rather than guesswork. When a model hits its quota, times out or disappears, the next rung takes the call and the dead one is put on a cooldown so nobody pays for it twice.

It's not just an assistant — it's an extension of your digital life.

## 🚀 Capabilities

### Core Features
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🧑‍🎤 Holographic Avatar | An animated human head in the HUD — real facial geometry, lit and drawn in software, no GPU or extra packages |
| 👄 Real Lip-Sync | ~50 mouth shapes a second from the audio's formants **and** the transcript — closures, spreads and rounds, not a volume meter |
| 🌍 Language-Free Mouth | Articulation is derived by Unicode reduction, so Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts all work from one rule set |
| 🙂 Facial Acting | Brows track the phrase, gaze saccades between fixations, natural blinking, a small nod on stressed syllables |
| 😐 Face as Status | Looks away while thinking, meets your eyes while listening, lids fall while asleep, glances down at new content |
| 🎚️ Push-to-Talk | Hold **Ctrl+Space** and the mic opens — closed the rest of the time. Truly global on Windows, window-scoped elsewhere |
| 🔇 Self-Echo Guard | Never answers its own last sentence: the tail of its own voice is recognised and dropped without muting you |
| 🪪 Runtime Self-Knowledge | Name, OS, abilities **and limits** are generated from the live system each session — rename it or add a plugin and it knows |
| 🎙️ Wake Word | Local **"Hey Sarthi"** detection — sleeps until called, auto-sleeps after 2 min of silence, and never streams audio while asleep |
| ⚡ Instant Acknowledgment | Speaks a short, context-aware reply in **your language** the instant a longer task starts — no more silent waiting |
| 🚀 Faster Live Engine | Runs on **Gemini 3.1 Flash Live** — roughly 2× faster time-to-first-word than the previous model |
| 🧩 Self-Describing Skills | Every bundled skill declares its own `TOOL` dict + handler and is auto-discovered at launch |
| 🧠 Recallable Memory | No size limit and nothing silently forgotten — the prompt carries what fits, the rest is looked up on demand from a local search |
| 👁️ Memory Panel | See every fact SARTHI has stored about you, when it learned it, and delete any of it in one click |
| ↩️ Undo | Take back what the assistant did — files it moved, renamed, created or wrote, and settings it changed |
| ⚠️ Real Confirmation | Shutdown, restart and WiFi wait for a button **you** press — the model cannot confirm its own irreversible actions |
| 🎧 Audio Device Picker | Choose the microphone and speakers by name, filtered to the short list your OS shows |
| 🔗 Session Continuity | A dropped connection, a voice change or a device change no longer wipes the conversation |
| 🧩 Plugin System | Drop a single `.py` file into `plugins/` — SARTHI learns a new skill on next launch |
| 📺 Video on the HUD | Plays YouTube, a local file or any video URL **where the avatar sits** — starts muted, sound on request |
| 🪜 Model Ladder | Nine Gemini models in one measured order — a quota, a timeout or an outage steps to the next rung instead of failing |
| 🎙️ Real-time Voice | Ultra-low latency conversation in any language via Gemini Live API |
| 🎨 Live Theming | Recolour the entire HUD from a hue wheel or hex — the avatar retints with it |
| 〰️ Reactive HUD | Waveform pulses to real audio — your mic while listening, SARTHI while speaking |
| 🎙️ Voice Picker | Choose from 5 native Gemini voices and switch live from the UI — no restart |
| ♾️ Unlimited Sessions | Sliding-window context compression — one conversation can last for hours |
| 🖥️ System Control | Launch apps, adjust volume/brightness, WiFi, shortcuts, power — all by voice |
| 🧩 Autonomous Tasks | High-level planning for complex multi-step goals via agent mode |
| 👁️ Visual Awareness | Screen capture and webcam vision piped into your main Gemini session, labelled by source |
| 🧠 Persistent Memory | Deeply remembers projects, preferences, and personal context across sessions |
| ⌨️ Hybrid Input | Seamlessly switch between keyboard typing and voice commands |
| 🌅 Morning Briefing | On first boot: greets you, reads the time, recaps yesterday, and fetches live news |
| 🔔 Proactive 2.0 | Time-aware, context-aware check-ins — knows the time of day, your projects, and what you've been discussing |
| 🗓️ Session Memory | Summarises each conversation and mentions it naturally next morning |
| 👁️‍🗨️ Background Monitoring | User-configured topic watching — checks for new headlines once a day and alerts naturally |
| 📊 Hardware Monitoring | Continuous CPU, RAM, GPU and temperature telemetry with localized voice alerts |
| 🌤️ Weather Report | Live weather data for your city, personalized from memory |
| 🗺️ Dynamic Content Panel | Scrollable display layer beneath the HUD that renders web results, news, and search data |
| 🔍 Multi-Mode Web Search | `news` / `research` / `price` / `compare` / `search` — Gemini Grounded first, DDG fallback |
| ⏰ Smart Reminders | OS-native scheduled notifications (Windows Task Scheduler / macOS LaunchAgent / Linux systemd) |
| 📂 File Processor | Read, summarize, and answer questions about local files |
| 🌐 Browser Control | Open URLs, navigate tabs, and interact with the browser by voice |
| 📨 Send Message | Compose and send messages through WhatsApp, Telegram, and more |
| 🖱️ Desktop Control | Taskbar, window management, and desktop-level operations |
| 📱 Remote Dashboard | Control the assistant from your phone via QR code pairing |
| ⚡ Auto-Start on Boot | Registers with the OS startup system (registry / LaunchAgent / .desktop) |
| 📋 Clipboard Intelligence | Copy any text → floating panel with Translate / Summarise / Explain / Fix |
| 🪪 Assistant Customization | Change the assistant name, your name, voice, and colour from the UI — takes effect immediately |

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
cd SARTHI
python setup.py        # installs deps for YOUR OS + the browser automation engine
python main.py
```

`setup.py` only ever installs what your operating system needs — the Windows-only libraries are skipped automatically on macOS and Linux, and vice-versa.

## 📋 Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **OS** | Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux |
| **Python** | 3.11, 3.12 or 3.13 |
| **Microphone** | Required for voice interaction (and for the "Hey Sarthi" wake word) |
| **Speakers** | Required for voice replies |
| **API Key** | Free Gemini API key (entered on first launch → `config/api_keys.json`) |
| **GPU** | **Not required.** The avatar is rendered in software, and so is HUD video |
| **YouTube on the HUD** | `yt-dlp`, installed by `setup.py` |
| **Wake word** *(optional)* | One-click download from ⚙ → WAKE WORD (`openwakeword`, a few MB, fully local) |

## 🔒 Your Data

Everything stays on your machine. There is no external server, no telemetry and no account.
Your voice is streamed to Google's Gemini Live API while a session is open; that is the one thing that leaves your computer, and it stops when you mute or close the app.
